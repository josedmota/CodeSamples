Instructions on the workflow:
1- Initial development of logic and integration with IEX cloud API is done on "Source"
folder

2- Then when the logic is fixed it is wraped in a flask app and an initial refactoring
is done to transform the logic into a REST api. (it is faster to test using flask).
This is done in the folder "Completed functions - In Testing".

3- The final integration with Azure cloud functions is done in the "Azure Functions" folder
this is where the final version of the function (the one uploaded to Azure) is developed
and stored.
